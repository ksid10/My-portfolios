# Project-1 (Structural Analysis Tool)

## Overview

The Structural Analysis Tool is a web application designed to assist engineers and students in visualizing and analyzing the behavior of beams under various loads. It provides insights into key structural properties and diagrams, allowing users to make informed design decisions. This tool is built using Streamlit and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Features

- **Beam Visualization:** Visualize the beam and the applied load.
- **Shear Force Diagram (SFD):** Understand the distribution of shear forces along the beam.
- **Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):** Visualize the bending moments acting on the beam.
- **Deflected Shape Diagram (DSD):** See the deflected shape of the beam under the applied load.
- **Axial Force Diagram (AFD):** Understand the distribution of axial forces in columns.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** Used for building the web application and creating the user interface.
- **Matplotlib:** Employed for generating various structural diagrams, including the beam visualization, shear force diagram, bending moment diagram, deflected shape diagram, and axial force diagram.
- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical computations and array operations.
- **GitHub:** The project is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and collaboration features.
- **Python:** The programming language used for implementing the tool and its functionalities.

## Usage

To run the Structural Analysis Tool locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application using `streamlit run structural_analysis_app.py`.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the tool:

- Visualize a simply supported beam with a distributed load.
- Analyze a cantilever beam with a point load at the free end.
- Calculate the deflection of a fixed-fixed beam under a uniform load.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following file and directories:

- `structural_analysis_app.py`: The main Streamlit application script.
