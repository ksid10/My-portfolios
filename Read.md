 "Structural analysis tool" Project Description

This structural analysis tool provides engineers and students with the ability to visualize and analyze the behavior of beams subjected to various loads. The tool includes the following diagrams:

Beam Visualization: Visualize the beam and the applied load.
Shear Force Diagram (SFD): Understand the distribution of shear forces along the beam.
Bending Moment Diagram (BMD): Visualize the bending moments acting on the beam.
Deflected Shape Diagram (DSD): See the deflected shape of the beam under the applied load.
Axial Force Diagram (AFD): Understand the distribution of axial forces in columns.
The tool is designed to assist with structural engineering analysis and design, offering insights into structural behavior and design decisions.

To use the tool, adjust the input parameters in the sidebar and visualize how the beam and its various properties change in response to different loads and materials.
